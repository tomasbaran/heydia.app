Let’s crack the dev plan open—publicly—for the first time.  
It’s time to start building Dia 1.0.

To stay true to Dia’s own philosophy, I’m applying the same weekly prioritization system:  
**🔴 Must**, **🟠 Should**, **🟢 Could**

This week, I’m aiming for:
- **🔴 Must tasks ~ 20h**
- **🟠 Must + Should ~ 30h**
