## 🙀 Why start another to-do app

There are a gazillion planning apps out there—todo apps, calendars, habit trackers…
So why build another one?

Because most of them are built around a **false binary**.

As [Paul Graham pointed out](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), there are two kinds of schedules:
- **The Manager’s Schedule** — driven by meetings, blocks of time, and calendars
- **The Maker’s Schedule** — driven by long, uninterrupted stretches of deep work and flexible to-do lists

**But what about the rest of us?**

We’re not always one or the other.
Even non-managers have dentist appointments and school reunions.
Even managers need blocks of creative, untouchable time.

That insight became the **foundation of Dia.** 

Dia gives you the **clarity of a calendar**—without the pressure of time-boxing every task.  
You decide what needs to get done today, **without tying it to a specific hour**.  
And when plans change (as they always do), you simply roll it to tomorrow.

That’s when I realized: even though the market is crowded, **nothing really fits this in-between mode**.  
I’ve tried dozens—analyzing, tweaking, even creating my own systems.  
The closest I found? A $20/month app—too steep, considering that planning well should be accessible to everyone.

So I decided to build my own.

Dia is a **simple, brain-friendly planner** that blends **todos, calendar, notes, and goals**—all in one.
And it’s designed around a few key ideas:

## 🧠 Idea 1: Effectivity — Tasks must be assigned to a date

The problem with traditional to-do apps is they just give you a list. If a task doesn’t have a date, it stays on that list forever and doesn't get done.

## 🏛️ Idea 2: Simple structure

![Dia Idea 2](/week1/idea2.png)

The interface has to be instantly clear:
**What’s for today? What’s for the week?**

Monthly views? Too much for the brain to process.
Who needs 30+ blocks competing for attention?

What works is a **Today** and **This Week** structure.
It also makes it easy to roll unfinished tasks forward from one day to the next.

## 💪🏼 Idea 3: Flexibility — Drag tasks around to different days

Life throws punches every day. Plans shift.
So the tool must adapt with us.

A weekly view lets us drag a task from Tuesday to Friday—without friction.
That kind of flexibility is key.

## 🏹 Idea 4: Vision — Weekly Objectives

If we only look at today, we lose the bigger picture.
Weekly objectives give direction. They help us see where we’re going—not just what we’re doing.

## 🚦 Idea 5: Prioritization — Must / Should / Could

Dia uses a traffic light model to keep priorities clear:
- 🔴 Must
- 🟠 Should
- 🟢 Could

No confusing tags or nested categories—just intuitive levels of importance.

## 📌 Dia Weekly objectives
