excerpt: "Before building the MVP, I needed to face a harder truth: building is easy—talking to users is not. Here's what I learned about pain, habits, and how to move forward."

Originally, I planned to write about the MVP.  
But midway through, I realized something more important: **talking to users**.  
I’d lost sight of that for a moment—this past week was about correcting course.

Here’s what I learned and what’s ahead.

## 🧠 Finding #1: Avoid the FFF Trap

I started with FFF: *Friends, Family, and Fools*.  
That was a mistake.

The signal is too noisy. The feedback lacks depth or relevance.  
Instead, I should be speaking with **power users and early adopters**—the productivity freaks.

These are the people who’ve tried every planning app, tweaked every method, and stress-tested countless systems.  
They don’t just have opinions—they have **pain**. And that’s where insight lives.

## 🔥 Finding #2: Pain Is the North Star

I initially asked:  
> Are you planning your day already?

Some people don’t plan—and don’t want to.
Others do—but feel no need to change.

Instead, I now ask:  
> **Is planning painful for you?**

Whether they plan or not doesn’t matter.  
What matters is whether their current system frustrates them.  
Now I ask: *“On a scale of 1–5, how painful is your current planning process?”*

**Pain is the signal. Pain is the metric.**

## 🤹‍♂️ The User vs. Product Dilemma

For Dia to succeed, I need to obsess equally over:
- The **user**
- The **product**

**Building?** I love.  
**Selling?** I dread. (Like most of us.)

So when do I shift between them?  
Or should I always be doing both?

I don’t have the perfect answer yet—but I’m exploring two approaches.

## 💡 Idea #1: Batching

1. Talk to users until 9 join the waitlist  
2. Build the MVP  
3. Notify the list  
4. Fill 9 slots 
5. Work closely with those users  
6. Improve the product  
7. Repeat with the next batch—maybe 19 this time.

---

## 💡 Idea #2: Continuous Selling

Talking to users is hard.  
It’s time-consuming. Emotionally taxing. Full of rejection.  
But it’s **essential**.

So I’m experimenting with a micro-habit:  
> **Talk to users first thing every morning. That’s it.**

To make it sustainable, here’s how I’m approaching it:

## 🧪 Productivity Hack #1: Build Habits That Stick

1. **Keep it light**  
   As [Paco Cantero said](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-run-personal-projects-without-overloading-your-already-complicated-life-02fc3c93a8a5): motivation must stay high, stress must stay low.  
   I’ll assign a short time block—no pressure.

2. **Timebox it**  
   Instead of “talk to 5 people,” I’ll commit to a fixed amount of time.  
   As [Dr. J.S. Virk](https://medium.com/readers-club/why-time-management-does-not-work-c09eea3796ab) pointed out: when success is tied to outcomes, inconsistency follows.  
   *Time is the only currency we all share—manage that instead.*

3. **[Bonus] Anchor it**  
   I’ll pair the habit with something I already do—like after my morning meditation.

## ⏳ My Plan

- **Week 1:** 15 minutes/day  
- **Week 2:** 20 minutes/day  
- **Week 3:** 25 minutes/day  
- **Then:** Reassess

My theory?  
**Undercommitting leads to overdelivery.**  
I’ll report back in a few weeks.

## 🧪 [Bonus] Productivity Hack #2: Half-Planning the Day

Besides documenting the Dia journey, I also want to share personal productivity tactics.

Here’s one I’ve started using:

Each morning, I log:
- Start time  
- My intended end time  
- Total available hours (e.g. 7h)  
- And I only plan for **half** of that (e.g. 3.5h)

I also note my **energy level (1–10)**.

**Why?**  
To become more thoughtful about what truly shapes the day.
