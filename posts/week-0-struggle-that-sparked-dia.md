excerpt: "I’ve spent the last few years building apps for others—now I’m building something for myself (and maybe for you too). Dia is my answer to years of struggling with focus, ADHD, and productivity tools that never quite fit. This is Week 0 of the journey: the why, the struggles, and the spark that started it all."

## 👋 Let Me Introduce Myself

![Tomas Baran, founder of Dia](/week0/dia-founder-tomas-baran.png)

My name is [Tomas Baran](https://tomasbaran.medium.com). I’ve been quiet over the past few years, honing my skills as a software developer—especially on the front end with Flutter.  
For the past five years, I’ve made a living building apps for others. It’s been fun, enriching, and full of learning.  
But deep down, I’ve always missed what I enjoyed the most: working on my own venture.

I’ve always been a bit of an adventurer. I moved my young family from Slovakia to Spain eight years ago,  
and then from Spain to Mexico three years ago. And I’m still craving new adventures.

At the start of every meaningful journey, there’s usually just one thing: desire.  
For years, I’ve been searching for a big problem—something that matters so much that people would pay to have it solved.

I think I finally found it.

## 🧠 The Problem

I suck at time management and focus. I procrastinate, get distracted, and drift away from what matters.  
I’ve long suspected ADHD, and after learning more about it recently, everything suddenly makes sense.  
It’s been affecting me every day for as long as I can remember.

Here’s what I’ve struggled with:

- Switching tasks (e.g., from a break to deep work and back)
- Working from home (especially with kids around)
- Multitasking (like reading news while waiting for a build)
- Getting distracted by unrelated thoughts mid-task
- Creating a clear plan for the day—and following it
- Defining and sticking to priorities

If any of this resonates with you, please write me.  
I know I’m not alone. And this isn’t a small problem—it has a huge impact on how we live and create.

## 🧪 The Missolutions

Over the years, I’ve tried a ton of tools:  
Wunderlist, Trello, Todoist, TickTick, Marvin, Slack, Forest, pen & paper…

None of them stuck.

They were either too rigid, too complex, or just didn’t match how my brain works.  
I needed something simple, but adaptable.

## 🛠️ What Did Work

Some habits helped—more than any tool:

- Meditation  
- Breathwork  
- Going to bed and waking up early
- Working out  
- Single-tasking (a.k.a. deep work)  
- Writing down daily and weekly priorities  
- Learning about dopamine, ADHD, and the brain

These helped, but not enough on their own.

What I’ve been missing is a tool that ties it all together.  
Something simple enough to use daily.  
Something that helps prioritize, plan, and track progress—without friction.

I want to build that tool, not just for myself, but for anyone who feels the same.  
Because at the end of the day, what matters is getting the right little things done consistently.
That takes structure, discipline, good sleep, courage… and the right companion.

## 🚀 The Solution: Introducing Dia

![Concept for the Dia app](/week0/dia-concept-sketch.jpg)

**Dia** is a tool to GSD (~~get shit done~~)—daily.  
Plan. Prioritize. Track.

Simple structure. Easy to follow.  
Because if you don’t use it daily, it can’t help.

## ⏭️ What’s Next?

I want to document everything:  
The ideas, the design, the development, the struggles, the wins, the stats, the user growth (or not), the finances—everything.

Updates will come weekly, biweekly, or monthly—whatever fits the pace.
I want to share the real journey of building something from scratch—while juggling family, work, and life.
