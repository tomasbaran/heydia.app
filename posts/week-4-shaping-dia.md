title: "[week 4] Dia: Defining the MVP"
date: "2025-08-5"
excerpt: "What will Dia 1.0 include? What will it skip? Here’s how I’m shaping the first version—from platforms and features to the future community."
---

The best way to launch is to launch fast. The sooner Dia can be used, the better. From there, it will only improve. But to ship quickly, I need to define what **one thing** it will do first.  
You may have [read the long-term vision](/blog/week-1-rethinking-planning)—but not everything can fit into version 1.0.

So, what will? And what won’t?

---

## 🖥️ Platform

The first decision: **which platform will Dia support from day one?**  
Answer: **Mobile and desktop as a responsive web app** (built in Flutter).


- **Why a responsive web app?** So you can check your day on your phone as well as on your desktop.
- **Why Flutter?** It’s modern, fast, multiplatform (web, desktop, iOS, Android…), and the one I fell in love with.

## ✅ Core Feature

Dia 1.0 will deliver on its [core promise](/blog/week-1-rethinking-planning):

> The **clarity of a calendar** (weekly view)  
> with the **flexibility of a to-do app** (no fixed times).

## 🧱 The Three Foundations

Version 1.0 will be built around [three simple ideas](/blog/week-1-rethinking-planning):

1. **Effectivity** — Tasks must be assigned to a day.
2. **Simple Structure** — Weekly and daily view only.
3. **Flexibility** — Drag tasks between days.

---

## ❌ What Dia 1.0 Won’t Include

It won’t include:

- Weekly Objectives or Must / Should / Could prioritization  
- Native apps (yet—Flutter makes it straightforward to expand later)  
- Any extras you might expect:  
  no time/date picker, no calendar sync, no lists, no tags, no rollover, no notes, no settings, no durations, no stats, no repeats… Heck, it won’t even have a possibility to sign-up.

## 🧠 Who Is Dia 1.0 For?

Dia 1.0 is for me—so I can finally start planning with a tool that fits my brain.

It’s the most stripped-down, essential version of a planning app I’ve always needed.  
I’ll beta test it solo for about a week.

After that, I’ll open up an **exclusive round for 9 users at $9**.

## 🚀 Dia 2.0 — Your Turn

What happens next? Honestly, I don’t know. Because from that point on, I won’t be the only one shaping Dia.

**Dia 1.0 is for me.**  
**Dia 2.0 is for you.**

Early users will help steer the roadmap. We'll hold **monthly votes** on what to build next—each user gets a voice.

---

## 🌱 Dia 3.0+

There will be future closed rounds for new users—each with a slightly higher price to join the founding community. I’ll announce those here, on the blog.
