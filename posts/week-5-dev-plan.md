title: "[week 5] Dia: Dev Plan in the Wild"
date: "2025-10-15"
excerpt: "Time to build. Here's how I’m tackling Dia’s first dev sprint—and how I’m using Dia’s own philosophy to plan it."

I’ve been off the radar for a bit—between family, school, travel, and work, life took the front seat.  
But I’m back now, and Dia’s moving forward at full speed.

The biggest realization this week?  
I need to choose the **right target market**—people who’ve felt the pain of planning.

I’m not building for everyone. I’m building for:
> **Frustrated planners.**

To help filter the right users from the start, I created this onboarding link:  
👉 [Is Dia for me?](https://form.typeform.com/to/JHAvzNQy)

Now, it’s time to crack the dev plan open—**publicly**—for the first time.  
Dia 1.0 starts here.

This sprint’s plan:
- **🔴 Must tasks: ~32h**
